# Investigating Biodiversity Intactness in the Phoenix metropolitan area

### Context & Purpose

In 2021, Maricopa County, which encompasses the Phoenix metropolitan area, was the US county that added the most developed land since 2001 [1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/land-development-urban-growth-maps/). Urban sprawl creates pressure on biodiversity and natural areas.

This repository contains a Python notebook with data exploration and analysis into the change in Biodiversity Intactness in the Phoenix metropolitan area in 2017 and 2020. I explore a dataset showing values for biodiversity intactness index (BII) [2](https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/pdfs/io-biodiversity/Biodiversity_Intactness_whitepaper.pdf), [3](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/io-biodiversity) to find changes in this BII around the Phoenix area from 2017 to 2020.



### Data Citation

- BII data:`io-biodiversity` collection, from the Microsoft Planetary Computer's STAC catalog. This dataset was generated by [Impact Observatory](https://www.impactobservatory.com/), in collaboration with [Vizzuality](https://www.vizzuality.com/). It contains terrestrial biodiversity intactness data at 100m resolution.
